Ontario Forest Biomonitoring Network: 1986-2017 Decline Index Data 
The Ontario Ministry of Environment, Conservation and Parks (Ministry) conducted this work through the Ontario Forest Biomonitoring Network (OFBN) in 1986-2017. 

The Decline sampling is described below. This sampling was conducted by the following organizations over the years:  Ecological Services for Planning Ltd. in 1986-1987, Beak Consultants in 1989-1991, Boreal Resources in 1994-2006, TECO Timber Natural Resource Group Ltd in 2008 and 2011, and Ministry staff and Watters Environmental Group Inc. in 2014, 2016 and 2017.

Any use of these data should acknowledge the Ontario Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Park's Ontario Forest Biomonitoring Network program.  

The Ministry is not liable for any interpretation or conclusions made with the data.

In 1985, the Ministry established the OFBN, a long-term monitoring program that monitors hardwood forest health. The program was initiated in response to widespread reports of forest decline in North America and Europe, and the implication that air pollution was a causal factor. The main objective of the OFBN has been to establish and maintain a province-wide database on the visual symptoms of forest health for the province’s mixed hardwood forests. In total, 110 permanent forest observation plots were established in 1986 across the range of the mixed hardwood forests in southern and central Ontario. A new site was added in 2010. Currently, 93 plots are monitored as sampling has been discontinued in 18 plots for various reasons. The plots have been sampled in 1986, 1987, 1989, 1990-2006, 2008, 2011, 2014, 2016 and 2017 years.

The initial objectives of the forest health monitoring were:
1. “to establish a network of permanent observation plots in which baseline data can be obtained regarding the condition of the hardwood forest tree species (sugar maple was the primary target species).
2. to develop a rating system to assess the condition of hardwood trees with respect to the symptomatology experienced in Ontario.
3. to evaluate the assessment data and determine if regional differences are apparent in forest tree condition” (MOE 1989).  

The current program has the same objectives, and is able to assess changes over the years. Each tree is marked in the plot and is monitored over the years. 

OFBN Permanent Monitoring Plots
Initially, plots contained 100 trees that had diameters greater than 10 cm at breast height (DBH) and were closest to the post in the centre of the plot.  In 1991, the plots were changed to square quadrats (50 m X 50 m).  Some of the initial 100 trees were outside the 50 m x 50 m quadrats and monitoring continued on them.  The plots contain between 93 and 307 trees greater than 10 cm in DBH, for a total of over 18,000 trees in the program. A total of 34 hardwood and conifer species have been found in plots. 

The plots are located on lands owned either privately by individuals or businesses, First Nations, Conservation Authorities, Ontario provincial or national parks, and the Niagara Parks Commission. 
The Ministry thanks these land owners for their continued cooperation and permission to conduct monitoring in the forest plots on their lands. 

The following criteria were used to select the sites. 

* In ambient forest conditions that are representative of general conditions in the area, and avoid point sources of contaminants or pollutants
* Across the hardwood forest range in the province 
* 1 or more plots every 100 square km with additional plots in areas initially thought to have higher decline or located in the nearby vicinity of some plots
* Sugar Maple Dominant

The Decline Index
The Decline Index is the metric developed by the Ministry to assess hardwood forest decline patterns to quantify tree stress symptoms that have been observed to respond to air pollution and other stressors.  

The Decline Index is a weighted measure of four stress parameters for every mature hardwood stem (> 10 cm of Diameter at Breast Height) inside the plot or initial 100 trees outside the plot. 

DI = CD + (A * UL) + (A * ST) + (A * SL/2)  

Where
DI = Decline Index
CD = % Crown Dieback (percent cover of branches with no live foliage in crown)
A = ([100-CD]/400
UL = % Undersized leaves of remnant live foliage
ST = % leaves with strong chlorosis i.e., dark yellow throughout leaves of remnant live foliage
SL = % leaves with slight chlorosis of light yellow-pale green throughout leaves or leaf edges of remnant live foliage

Chlorosis and undersized leaves are excellent indicators of short-term stress within a year whereas persistent stress across years is measured by crown dieback.  Thus, crown dieback is weighted more heavily in the DI than the foliage short-term stress indicators.  Strong chlorosis is also weighted more heavily than slight chlorosis; highly stressed trees have a larger influence on the DI.  Conifer softwoods were not assessed for decline as their needles do not respond the same way to stresses as hardwood foliage.  

The Decline Index is calculated to the nearest whole number and ranges from zero (0) for a tree stem with no symptoms to one hundred (100) for a stem with maximum decline that does not have any live foliage.  The Decline Index is divided into five classes of decline incidence to indicate the severity of decline for plot averages:  

Very Low (< 11), 
Low (11-15), 
Moderate (16-20), 
High (21 - 25) and 
Severe (> 25) (MOE 1989).  

These decline incidence classes were determined by forest experts to provide a measure of tree or forest stand health.
